Enigma Machine
==============

Enigma machines were notably used in WWII to encrypt/decrypt messages between German forces.  At London Software Craftsmanship 2012, there was an interesting challenge to code an Enigma machine.  This is my attempt.

This is a challenging exercise that can be used to promote discussions regarding TDD approaches.
